# My First Journey with Game Development

I've always been captivated by video games. From the immersive stories to the intricate mechanics, the magic of interactive entertainment has always drawn me in. So, once I started my journey as a programmer, it was only a matter of time before the curiosity to _create_ my own game became irresistible. And that's how **Satyr's Escape** was born! My very first hobby game, a 2D experience crafted with the Godot engine!

### From Simple Concept to an Intriguing World

My initial idea was to build a simple clone of _Flappy Bird_. It's a classic for a reason: easy to understand, challenging to master and a great starting point for learning game development fundamentals. However, I didn't want to just copy it. I wanted to add my own personal touch, to infuse it with a theme that felt unique and intriguing.

That's where the concept of **Satyr's Escape** came in. I envisioned a dark, mystical forest, with a unique main character _(I chose a Satyr)_ racing through it, _"pursued"_ by relentless demons. The goal was to make the simple premise feel atmospheric and engaging, drawing players into this mysterious world.

### Evolving Gameplay: Beyond Just Dodging

While the core mechanic is similar to _Flappy Bird_ â€“ dodging obstacles. I wanted to introduce a couple of twists to make **Satyr's Escape** feel more dynamic and well, _my own_.

First, the trees Satyr has to dodge. Initially, they're static, allowing players to get a feel for the rhythm. But as you progress, these seemingly innocent trees begin to move! This subtle change ramps up the difficulty significantly, forcing quicker reactions and more precise movements.

Then, there's the **fireball attack**. This was a really fun addition. When you reach a certain point in the game, the music shifts to a more intense, foreboding track. Suddenly, flying demons appear amidst the trees, blocking your path. This is where Satyr's hidden power comes into play: you have to unleash a fireball to clear your way before attempting to squeeze through the gaps. It adds a layer of strategy and a moment of offensive action to an otherwise avoidance-based game.

### The Satisfaction of Creation

Seeing **Satyr's Escape** come to life was incredibly rewarding. From the initial concept to tweaking the mechanics and polishing the visuals, every step of the process was a learning experience. It's truly a great feeling to take an idea and transform it into something interactive and playable.

You can play it now!
